If you checkout the CVS version, then you must also checkout an admin dir for this skim support to work:

$cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scim login
(just press enter)

then under this dir (where this README resides)
$cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scim co -P -d admin skim/admin

the bootstrap script always trys to do this for you.
