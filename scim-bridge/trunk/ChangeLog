	* agent/scim-bridge-agent-kernel.cpp, agent/scim-bridge-agent.cpp,
	  client-common/scim-bridge-client-messenger.c,
	  common/scim-bridge-messenger.c: Added the proper shutdown hook.
	  Now you can shutdown the agent by "TERM" signal.

	* agent/.cvsignore, client-gtk/.cvsignore: Just uploaded a dot file
	  for Eclipse.

	  1. The agent now launch by itself.  2. The "debugflags" and
	  "debuglevel" options are now changed into
	  "SCIM_BRIDGE_DEBUG_FLAGS" and "SCIM_BRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL" 3. There
	  are basic support for multiclients.

	  Not enough codes are there. Don't try this.) 3. Get rid of the
	  segfault caused by re-initialization. (Notice: Reconnection is
	  not yet supported by another reason.)
