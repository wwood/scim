* Introduction

Scim-hangul is a SCIM IMEngine module for inputing korean scripts. Scim-hangul
is for native speakers, not for foreigners. If you don't want to learn korean
keyboard layout, use scim-table :)

no-shift and etc. You can input chinese character (hanja) with F9 key when you

    area (or system tray). Move the focus to some widgets which can input
    text and click the SCIM icon in Notification area, then you can see

    input korean.

    You can change keyboard layouts on SCIM palette.
