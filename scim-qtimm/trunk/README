Requires Qt >= 4.0.0

if you want skim support, requires >= skim 1.2.0

By default, the scim qt-immodule plugin will be installed into
$QTLIBPATH/plugins/inputmethods

Use this to specify the qt4 lib:
QTDIR=/usr scons debug=1 qtlibs=/usr/lib/qt4/ qtincludes=/usr/include/qt4
(if you do not have scons installed, replace scons with ./configure, after ./configure, use ./scons to compile and ./scons install to install)

the translation file will be installed under "$datadir"/locale
